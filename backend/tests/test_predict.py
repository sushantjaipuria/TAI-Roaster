Unit Tests for Prediction Routes

This module contains comprehensive tests for the prediction API endpoints:
- /predict endpoint testing with various inputs
- /upload endpoint testing with different file types
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Performance and load testing

Test categories:
- Happy path testing with valid inputs
- Error handling with invalid data
- File upload testing with various formats
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Performance testing with large portfolios
- Edge case testing (empty portfolios, invalid symbols)

Test fixtures:
- Sample portfolio data in various formats
- Mock ML model responses
- File upload test data
- Error response examples

Dependencies:
- pytest for test framework
- pytest-asyncio for async endpoint testing
- httpx for API client testing
- Mock objects for external dependencies

Usage:
- Run with: pytest backend/tests/
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage reporting and quality gates
