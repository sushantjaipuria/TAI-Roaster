Stock Classification Predictor

This module provides classification-based predictions for stocks:
- Buy/Hold/Sell recommendations
- Risk level classifications (Low/Medium/High)
- Sector momentum classifications
- Quality and growth classifications

Key classifications:
- Action recommendations: Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Sell, Strong Sell
- Risk categories: Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk
- Momentum: Bullish, Neutral, Bearish
- Quality: High Quality, Medium Quality, Low Quality
- Growth: High Growth, Moderate Growth, Value

Model types:
- Multi-class classification for recommendations
- Binary classification for specific signals
- Hierarchical classification for nested categories
- Multi-label classification for multiple attributes

Features:
- Probability scores for each class
- Confidence measures for classifications
- Feature importance for decision explanation
- Threshold tuning for precision/recall optimization

Integration:
- Combines with regression predictions for complete analysis
- Provides categorical insights for user interface
- Supports rule-based portfolio screening
- Enables natural language recommendation generation
