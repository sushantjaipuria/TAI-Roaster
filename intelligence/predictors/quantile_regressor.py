Quantile Regression Predictor

This module implements quantile regression for robust prediction intervals:
- Direct prediction of quantiles (e.g., 10th, 50th, 90th percentiles)
- Robust to outliers and non-normal distributions
- Asymmetric prediction intervals
- Risk-aware predictions for downside protection

Key capabilities:
- Multi-quantile predictions in single model
- Asymmetric risk assessment (upside vs downside)
- Robust performance during market stress
- Direct optimization for specific risk levels
- Non-parametric uncertainty estimation

Quantile targets:
- Conservative: 10th, 25th percentiles for downside risk
- Central: 50th percentile (median) for central tendency
- Optimistic: 75th, 90th percentiles for upside potential
- Extreme: 5th, 95th percentiles for tail risk

Applications:
- Downside risk assessment for portfolio protection
- Asymmetric optimization for risk-averse investors
- Tail risk estimation for stress testing
- Robust prediction intervals during market volatility

Integration:
- Complements probabilistic predictors
- Used for risk-focused portfolio analysis
- Provides asymmetric confidence intervals
- Supports stress testing and scenario analysis
