Performance Metrics and Evaluation

This module provides comprehensive metrics for model and strategy evaluation:
- Statistical metrics for prediction accuracy
- Financial metrics for portfolio performance
- Risk metrics for downside protection
- Utility metrics for investor preferences

Statistical metrics:
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R², adjusted R²
- Classification: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC
- Forecast: Hit rate, directional accuracy, forecast bias
- Correlation: IC (Information Coefficient), rank IC
- Significance: t-statistics, p-values, confidence intervals

Financial metrics:
- Returns: Arithmetic return, geometric return, log return
- Annualized: Annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio
- Excess: Alpha, beta, tracking error, information ratio
- Drawdown: Maximum drawdown, average drawdown, recovery time
- Consistency: Win rate, profit factor, expectancy

Risk metrics:
- Volatility: Standard deviation, downside deviation
- VaR: Value at Risk at different confidence levels
- CVaR: Conditional Value at Risk (Expected Shortfall)
- Tail: Tail ratio, extreme value statistics
- Stability: Volatility of volatility, regime changes

Utility metrics:
- Risk-adjusted: Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, Sterling ratio
- Behavioral: Maximum pain, Ulcer index, pain index
- Preference: Certainty equivalent, utility scores
- Economic: Portfolio turnover, transaction costs
- Efficiency: Mean reversion, momentum persistence

Integration:
- Used by backtest.py for strategy evaluation
- Provides metrics for model_trainer.py validation
- Supports comparative analysis across models
- Generates standardized performance reports
