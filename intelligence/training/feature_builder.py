Feature Engineering Pipeline

This module creates engineered features for ML model training and prediction:
- Technical indicators and price patterns
- Fundamental ratios and growth metrics
- Market regime and sentiment features
- Cross-sectional and time-series features

Technical features:
- Momentum: RSI, MACD, Price momentum, Rate of change
- Trend: Moving averages, trend strength, breakout signals
- Volatility: Bollinger Bands, ATR, volatility regimes
- Volume: Volume indicators, price-volume divergence
- Pattern: Chart patterns, support/resistance levels

Fundamental features:
- Valuation: P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA ratios
- Quality: ROE, ROA, debt ratios, interest coverage
- Growth: Revenue growth, earnings growth, book value growth
- Efficiency: Asset turnover, inventory turnover
- Profitability: Gross margin, operating margin, net margin

Market features:
- Relative performance vs market and sector
- Beta and correlation with market indices
- Sector rotation and momentum
- Market regime (bull/bear/sideways)
- Sentiment indicators and market breadth

Advanced features:
- Principal component analysis for dimension reduction
- Time-lagged features for temporal patterns
- Interaction features between technical and fundamental
- Cross-sectional rankings and percentiles
- Regime-dependent features

Integration:
- Takes raw data from data_loader.py
- Provides features to all predictor modules
- Caches computed features for efficiency
- Supports both training and inference pipelines
