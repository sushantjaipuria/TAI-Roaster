Model Training Pipeline

This module handles training of all ML models in the prediction pipeline:
- XGBoost regression models for price predictions
- NGBoost models for uncertainty quantification
- Quantile regression for risk assessment
- Classification models for categorical predictions

Training workflow:
- Data preparation and train/validation/test splits
- Hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation
- Model training with early stopping and regularization
- Model validation and performance evaluation
- Model serialization and versioning

Training features:
- Time-series aware cross-validation
- Walk-forward validation for financial data
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or GridSearch
- Feature selection and importance analysis
- Model ensemble and stacking techniques

Model management:
- Model versioning and experiment tracking
- Performance monitoring and drift detection
- Automated retraining triggers
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
- Model artifact management and deployment

Evaluation metrics:
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, RÂ², Sharpe ratio, Information ratio
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC
- Financial: Maximum drawdown, Calmar ratio, hit rate
- Risk: VaR accuracy, coverage probability

Integration:
- Uses data from data_loader.py and features from feature_builder.py
- Saves trained models to models/ directory
- Integrates with evaluation/ modules for validation
- Supports both scheduled and on-demand retraining
