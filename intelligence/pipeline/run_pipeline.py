"""
Master Prediction Pipeline

This module orchestrates the complete prediction workflow:
- Portfolio analysis and stock scoring
- Multi-model prediction ensemble
- Risk assessment and uncertainty quantification
- Insight generation and recommendation synthesis

Pipeline workflow:
1. Input validation and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering for portfolio stocks
3. Multi-model prediction generation
4. Uncertainty quantification and risk assessment
5. Recommendation synthesis and ranking
6. Insight generation with LLM
7. Result formatting and output preparation

Model ensemble:
- XGBoost for primary price predictions
- NGBoost for uncertainty quantification
- Quantile regression for risk assessment
- Classification for categorical recommendations
- Weighted combination based on historical performance

Risk integration:
- Portfolio-level risk metrics
- Stock-level risk assessment
- Correlation and concentration analysis
- Stress testing and scenario analysis
- Downside protection recommendations

Output generation:
- Ranked stock recommendations with scores
- Portfolio optimization suggestions
- Risk warnings and alerts
- Actionable insights and explanations
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates

Performance:
- Caching for repeated requests
- Parallel processing for large portfolios
- Incremental updates for portfolio changes
- Real-time vs batch processing modes

Integration:
- Called by backend routes/predict.py
- Uses all predictor modules and LLM insights
- Provides structured output to services/formatter.py
- Supports both single stock and portfolio analysis
